# Items of Related interest

### [Updated version of early 2000s booklet on R](../usingR-Booklet/)

This is now to a large extent superseded by tutorials that are available on the web. Beginning R users may nonetheless find it useful as an introductory document for learning about R.

### [What does the data say? -- Traps to Avoid](https://bookdown.org/jhmaindonald/datathoughts/)

This collection of "examples that inform and educate", taken 
from the media and from the published literature, is used to illustrate some of the ready traps to which data analysts can readily fall. The booklet is in the style of what Kahneman (2013), in his book *Thinking Fast and Slow*, calls "educating gossip". Its examples may be used to supplement, or in a few cases offer a further perspective on, those in *A Practical Guide to R*. The source files are all available from
