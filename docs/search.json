    "text": "Inference remains a hotly contested area.\nWe have used Bayes Factors, calculated assuming the family of ‘uninformative’ priors used in the BayesFactor package, as a way to make a connection from the hypothesis testing framework of frequentist statistics into the Bayesian world. As the calculations use a numerical approximation that avoids the need for the extensive chain of simulations required for the Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, it is straightforward to make comparisons with \\(p\\)-values for a range of sample sizes, effect sizes, and scale parameter for the prior.\nAs Kahneman1 argues in his book on human judgment and decision making, humans are not good intuitive statisticians. This surely applies as much or more to the choice of Bayesian priors as to the judgments that are required in more classical contexts.\nHow does the Bayes Factor change with changes in the effect size, sample size, and number of model parameters? What is the effect of varying the scale parameter for the prior distribution? What circumstances create a case for centering the prior away from the null? The start that we have made at working with the prior families used in the BayesFactor package to provide graphs that can help answer such questions could usefully be extended much further. What difference does it make if a Cauchy prior is replaced by a normal prior, with roughly matched ranges of scale factors?\nMore attention to Bayesian credible intervals would have been made sense. Arguably, these make better sense than Bayes Factors if the interest is in finding a replacement for \\(p\\)-values and associated confidence intervals.\nInformation statistics – primarily AIC, AICc, and BIC – are a further focus. Associated relative preference measures, with a role similar to that of Bayes Factors, are noted. The BIC relative preference measure can be regarded as arising from the Bayes Factor obtained when a Jeffreys Unit Information prior is used that is centered away from the null.2\nNote especially the Subsection 2.9.2 comparison between Bayes Factors and the BIC statistic, for the one-sample \\(t\\)-test case. At the largest sample sizes (\\(n\\) = 80 and \\(n\\)=160) the Bayes Factor, while always smaller than the BIC ‘relative preference’ statistic, comes close to it in value. Larger sample sizes will be required to obtain a similar rough equivalence when the comparison is between two models that have one or more explanatory variables in common.\nThese various statistics are tools, to be used with appropriate caution, and having regard to what is known about the studies that generated the data."

Effect sizes for the replications have mostly been found to be on average much lower than for the original experiment. A major part of the difference is no doubt caused by selection effects, from publishing mainly or only those results that fall under a \\(p\\) &lt;= 0.05 or similar criterion.\nThere is a strong case for the publication in some form of all studies that effmeet minimum design and execution standards. Stricter experimental design criteria are called for, perhaps designing for \\(p \\leq 0.005\\) rather than the common \\(p \\leq 0.05\\)."

    "text": "Simulation has many uses\nThe model that is fitted is just one of the models that might have been fitted. Simulation can be used to repeatedly generate new data from the fitted model, then refitting the model to each set of new data. Overall, the different refits give an indication of how different another model fit, from data generated in the same way as the data presented for analysis, might have been. Do indications of departures from model assumptions for diagnostic plots for the fitted model lie within the range observed in the simulations? What is the extent of variation of \\(p\\)-values or other statistics that are of interest?\nSimulation can provide important insights when experiments are planned. Thus, where two treatments will be compared, it is insightful to simulate results for one or more effect sizes that are of interest. If sample sizes are overly small, statistics from the simulations (e.g., effect sizes, \\(p\\)-values, or other statistics) will show large variation from one simulation to another. There would be merit in requiring reports of results from experimental trials to show plots of relevant statistics that were examined at the study planning stage. Experimenters should have as clear as possible an understanding, before proceeding, of the ability of the experiment to discriminate between treatments. Steps taken to obtain this understanding should be reported."

Where judged necessary, these are filled out in more detail in later chapters. Notes are included on reproducible reporting using R Markdown, and on project management.\nP-values get much more critical attention than in the earlier text. They are contrasted, in a classical hypothesis testing context, with Bayes Factors, calculated assuming a standard family of ‘uninformative’ priors used in the BayesFactor package that allows use of a numerical approximation. As the calculations do not involve simulation, it is straightforward to make comparisons with \\(p\\)-values for a range of sample sizes, effect sizes, and scale parameters for the prior.\nInformation statistics – primarily AIC, AICc, and BIC – are a further focus. Associated relative preference measures, with a role similar to that of Bayes Factors, are noted.\nThere is extended commentary on the insight that studies where a substantial number of published experimental results have been independently replicated offer on what p-values mean in practice. Selection effects that result from the use of a \\(p\\) &lt;= 0.05 criterion for publication have been a major contributor to effect size estimates that may on average be too large by a factor that may be 2.0 or more. A case is made for the publication in some form of all studies that meet minimum design and execution standards. Stricter experimental design criteria are called for, perhaps designing for \\(p \\leq 0.005\\) rather than the common \\(p \\leq 0.05\\),\nSimulation and resampling approaches get more extended use – as sources of insight, as devices for building intuition, and as mechanisms for obtaining sampling distributions when theoretical results are not available.\nAn important addition is the treatment of gene expression and other contexts where there may be hundreds or thousands of p-values.\nThe discussion on choosing models and checking model fits has been revised and extended.\nThe treatment of Generalized Additive Models has been rewritten and extended. There is new content on quantile regression with automatic choice of smoothing parameter, and on fitting monotonic increasing or decreasing response curves as specific forms of shape constrained additive response.\nThe treatment of models that allow for extra-binomial or extra-Poisson variation has been substantially extended.\nExponential time series (ETS) get greater attention, especially for their use in forecasting. Modeling of seasonal terms now gets attention.\nChanges in the lme4 package for fitting mixed-effects models, and the implementation of the Kenward-Roger approach that is now available in the afex package, have required substantial rewrites. There is a new section on “A mixed model with a betabinomial error.” The calculation of lethal time estimates and confidence intervals (primarily targeted at plant quarantine work) uses the first author’s qra (quantal response analysis) package.\nTree diagrams from tree-based regression have been finessed. There is now more attentio n to the handling of prior probabilities. The discussion introduces issues and ideas that are important for machine learning approaches more generally. The absence of coverage of machine learning methods more generally is an important omission.\nPrincipal component calculations now use the function prcomp(), which uses a singular value decomposition approach and is preferred to princomp(). A new section on “High dimensional data – RNA-Seq gene expression” demonstrates approaches now available for analysing data of this general type.\nA new section treats hierarchical and other forms of clustering.\nThe treatment of causal inference from observational data has been greatly extended, with extensive commentary on relevant R packages, and discussion of examples from the literature. Approaches to matching are a particular focus, with extensive references given. The use of directed acyclic graphs as a mechanism for making clear causal pathway assumptions is noted and references given, but not further discussed.\nThere is some limited attention to the use of multiple imputation to fill in missing values in data where some observations are incomplete, allowing use of those observations in a regression or other further analysis.\nAn appendix gives a brief overview of key features of the R system and notes technical issues that have particular relevance for users of the text.\nIn Chapter 2 and on, code is given only for those figures that are specifically targeted at the methodology under discussion. This site will be used as a first point of reference for R markdown scripts that have all the code from the book, and other supplementary materials.\nThe CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) repository contains, at the time of writing, close to 20,000 packages. Further packages are available on other repositories, with Bioconductor perhaps the most important. Several others are listed upon typing setRepositories() at the command line. The 20,000 contrasts with the around 2,000 packages that were on CRAN prior to 2010 when the third edition of “Data Analysis and Graphics Using R” was in preparation. We have tried to keep up to date with new packages that supplement or extend what was available, but some will undoubtedly have been missed.\n\nReflections, looking back on the text in its published form, appear in “Afterword”."
